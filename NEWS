- Problem and algorithm ids may now contain the dot char (".").
- Fixed a bug in summarizeExperiments where column "repl" was not correctly
  handled in the output
- Added convenience function getExperimentParts()

  missing results if explicitly requested

BatchExperiments_1.4
- Updated to use RSQLite >=1.0.0
- Argument 'progressbar' added to multiple functions to suppress displaying the
  progress bars.

\title{Construct a registry object for experiments.}
\usage{
makeExperimentRegistry(id = "BatchExperimentRegistry", file.dir,
  sharding = TRUE, work.dir, multiple.result.files = FALSE, seed,
  packages = character(0L), src.dirs = character(0L),
  src.files = character(0L), skip = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Name of registry. Displayed e.g. in mails or in cluster queue.
Default is \dQuote{BatchExperimentRegistry}.}

\item{file.dir}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Path where files regarding the registry / jobs should be saved.
Default is dQuote{<name of registry>_files} in current working directory.}

\item{sharding}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Enable sharding to distribute result files into different subdirectories?
Important if you have many experiments.
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{work.dir}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Working directory for R process when experiment is executed.
Default is the current working directory when registry is created.}

\item{multiple.result.files}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should a result file be generated for every list element of the
returned list of the algorithm function?
Note that your algorithm functions in \code{\link{addAlgorithm}} must
return named lists if this is set to \code{TRUE}.
The result file will be named \dQuote{<id>-result-<element name>.RData}
instead of \dQuote{<id>-result.RData}.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{seed}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Start seed for experiments. The first experiment in the registry will use this
seed, for the subsequent ones the seed is incremented by 1.
Default is a random number from 1 to \code{.Machine$integer.max/2}.}

\item{packages}{[\code{character}]\cr
Packages that will always be loaded on each node.
Default is \code{character(0)}.}

\item{src.dirs}{[\code{character}]\cr
Directories relative to your \code{work.dir} containing R scripts
to be sourced on registry load (both on slave and master).
Files not matching the pattern \dQuote{\\.[Rr]$} are ignored.
Useful if you have many helper functions that are needed during the execution of your jobs.
These files should only contain function definitions and no executable code.
Default is \code{character(0)}.}

\item{src.files}{[\code{character}]\cr
R scripts files relative to your \code{work.dir}
to be sourced on registry load (both on slave and master).
Useful if you have many helper functions that are needed during the execution of your jobs.
These files should only contain function definitions and no executable code.
Default is \code{character(0)}.}

\item{skip}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Skip creation of a new registry if a registry is found in \code{file.dir}.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
[\code{\link{ExperimentRegistry}}]
}
\description{
Note that if you don't want links in your paths (\code{file.dir}, \code{work.dir}) to get resolved and have
complete control over the way the path is used internally, pass an absolute path which begins with \dQuote{/}.

Every object is a list that contains the passed arguments of the constructor.
